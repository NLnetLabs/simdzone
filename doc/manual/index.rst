=====================

Fast and standards compliant DNS presentation format parser.

DNS resource records (RRs) can be expressed in text form using the
presentation format. The format is most frequently used to define a zone in
master files, more commonly known as zone files, and is best considered a
concise tabular serialization format with provisions for convenient editing.

The format is originally defined in :RFC:`1035#section-5` and
:RFC:`1034#section-3.6.1`, but as the DNS is intentionally extensible, the 
format  has been extended over time.
